# Twitter Feed Experiment via Chrome Extension

## Development:

0. `npm install`

1. `npx webpack --watch`

2. Chrome > Extensions > Load Unpacked > Select `build` folder

This repo is set up with `crx-hotreload`, which means that as soon as files in the `build` directory are updated (with webpack), the Chrome page will reload itself.
